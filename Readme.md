# Two-wheeled self-balancing robot
In this project, we propose the linear and angular position control of a stepper-motor-driven self-balancing robot.      
A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is tuned to obtain accurate control of the system.      
## Operation
To find the gain vector K for the controller, run the m file 'lqr_self_balancing_robot.m'         
After that, run the file 'real_physical_model_SBR.slx' to simulate the robot.    
## Reference
For reference, you can also view the mathematical model of the SBR in 'self_balance_cart.slx'.    
For more details, view the report to understand how we calculate the system model and implement the control theory in both simulation and real physical model.
